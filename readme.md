## Overview

Companion app for Tower Dominion. Backups, book-keeping, analysis!

Planned features. Some already implemented:

* Track save files, make backups per round (grouping by run).
* Analysis, with visualizations, charts.
  * For example: per round cost efficiency for various buildings.
* Upload run logs to cloud storage.
  * Analysis should be available for both local and cloud logs.
* Easy rollback option.

Some of the code is written with the help of Claude Code. (And then rewritten...)
